# Product Requirements Document: Amazon Sellers Data Pipeline

## 1. Executive Summary

The Amazon Sellers Data Pipeline is a dedicated service responsible for extracting, processing, and storing information from the Amazon Seller Central help documentation. This pipeline will run on a monthly schedule or on-demand trigger.

## 2. Product Vision

To create a reliable, cost efficient, and extensible data pipeline that provides high quality, semantically chunked content from Amazon Seller documentation for consumption by our RAG system, with minimal maintenance requirements.

## 3. Business Objectives

1. **Content Completeness**: Ensure 100% coverage of relevant Amazon Seller documentation
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize operational costs through intelligent scheduling and processing
3. **Data Freshness**: Maintain knowledge base currency with monthly updates
4. **Extensibility**: Support future expansion to additional data sources
5. **Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% pipeline execution success rate

## 4. User Stories

1. As a system administrator, I want the pipeline to run automatically on a monthly schedule so that I don't have to manually trigger updates.
2. As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts when significant content changes are detected so that I can review them if needed.
3. As a system administrator, I want to manually trigger the pipeline when necessary so that I can force updates outside the regular schedule.
4. As a system administrator, I want detailed logs of pipeline execution so that I can troubleshoot issues.
5. As a RAG system, I want to consume semantically chunked content with rich metadata so that I can provide accurate responses.
