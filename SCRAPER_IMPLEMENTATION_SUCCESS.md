## üêõ Known Issues & Notes

### **Minor Issues**
1. **Deprecation Warning**: `start_requests()` method shows deprecation warning
   - **Impact:** None (still works in Scrapy 2.13)
   - **Fix:** Can migrate to async `start()` method in future

### **Optimizations Available**
1. **Resource Blocking**: Currently blocks images, fonts, media
   - Could add more resource types (stylesheets, some scripts)
   - Would improve speed but need to test impact on content

2. **Concurrent Requests**: Currently set to 1
   - Could increase to 2-3 for faster scraping
   - Need to monitor for rate limiting

3. **Content Selectors**: Using generic selectors
   - Could be more specific for better performance
   - Current approach is more robust to page changes

2. **QUICK_FIXES.md** - Step-by-step implementation guide
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUCCESS.md** - This file

## üîÆ Next Steps

### **Immediate (Ready to Use)**
- ‚úÖ Scraper is production-ready
- ‚úÖ Can be integrated into full pipeline
- ‚úÖ Change detection working for incremental updates

### **Optional Enhancements**
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Increase concurrent requests gradually
   - Implement smarter resource blocking
   - Add caching for static resources

2. **Content Processing**
   - Enhance HTML to Markdown conversion
   - Implement better text cleaning
   - Add structured data extraction (tables, lists)

3. **Monitoring**
   - Add metrics collection
   - Implement alerting for failures
   - Create dashboard for scraping stats

4. **Scaling**
   - Distribute scraping across multiple machines
   - Implement request queueing (RabbitMQ, Redis)
   - Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## üéì Lessons Learned

### **Key Insights**
1. **SPA Detection is Critical**: Always test if a site uses JavaScript rendering before choosing Scrapy alone
2. **Playwright Integration**: Well-documented and works seamlessly with Scrapy
3. **CrawlSpider Complexity**: Need to understand internal flow to override correctly
4. **Resource Optimization**: Blocking unnecessary resources significantly improves speed

### **Best Practices Applied**
- ‚úÖ Incremental testing (debug scripts first, then full spider)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns (spider, pipelines, storage)
- ‚úÖ Configuration-driven behavior (Settings class)
- ‚úÖ Version control for scraped data (hashing, timestamps)
